### Fabric Autoscale Code Implementation

The Fabric autoscale code is designed to work with two types of Logic Apps. Please select and implement the code that best fits your environment and requirements. The Consumption type Logic App is generally the easiest to set up, whereas the Standard type may involve a more extensive setup process but offers additional capabilities and flexibility.

## Consumption (Multi-tenant):

    - This type of Logic App is hosted on a multi-tenant infrastructure, making it simpler and quicker to set up.
    - Ideal for scenarios where ease of deployment and lower costs are prioritized.

## Standard (Workflow Service Plan):

    - This type of Logic App is hosted on a dedicated infrastructure, providing more control and scalability options.
    - Suitable for scenarios where higher performance, isolation, and additional features are required.
